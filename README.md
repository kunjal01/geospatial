• Developed a geospatial data processing system using PostgreSQL/PostGIS, enabling efficient spatial queries like convex hull calculations and nearest neighbor analysis. <br>
• Built backend APIs to integrate geospatial data with JavaScript-based visualizations in OpenLayers for real-time mapping. <br>
• Optimized spatial data storage and retrieval, reducing query execution time and improving scalability. <br>
• Generated geospatial datasets by computing latitude/longitude pairs and converting spatial relationships into KML and ESRI shapefiles for GIS integration. <br>
• Created an algorithm to generate Spirograph curves, visualizing mathematical models on mapping platforms.
