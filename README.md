• Developed a geospatial data processing system using PostgreSQL/PostGIS, enabling efficient spatial queries like convex hull calculations and nearest neighbor analysis.
• Built backend APIs to integrate geospatial data with JavaScript-based visualizations in OpenLayers for real-time mapping.
• Optimized spatial data storage and retrieval, reducing query execution time and improving scalability.
• Generated geospatial datasets by computing latitude/longitude pairs and converting spatial relationships into KML and ESRI shapefiles for GIS integration.
• Created an algorithm to generate Spirograph curves, visualizing mathematical models on mapping platforms.
